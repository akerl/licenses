2. License Grant

Subject to the conditions and limitations of this License and upon affirmative assent
to the commitments specified in Section 1.7 from an individual DPL User, Licensor
hereby grants and agrees to grant to such DPL User a worldwide, royalty-free, no-charge, non-exclusive, irrevocable (except as stated in Sections 3(e) and 3(f)) license, perpetual for the term of the relevant Licensed Patents, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and distribute Licensed Products and Services that would otherwise infringe any claim of Licensed Patents. A Licensee’s sale of Licensed Products and Services pursuant to this agreement exhausts the Licensor’s ability to assert infringement by a downstream purchaser or user of the Licensed Products or Services.

3. License Restrictions

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this License is expressly subject to and limited by the
following restrictions:

(a) No Sublicensing. This License does not include the right to sublicense any Licensed Patent of any Licensor.

(b) License Extends Solely to Licensed Patents in Connection with Licensed Products and Services. For clarity, this License does not purport to grant any rights in any Licensor’s copyright, trademark, trade dress, design, trade secret, other intellectual property, or any other rights of Licensor other than the rights to Licensed Patents granted in Section 2, nor does the License cover products or services other than the Licensed Products and Services.  

(c) Scope. This License does not include Patents with a priority date or Effective Filing Date later than Licensor’s last Discontinuation Date that has not been followed by a subsequent Offering Announcement by Licensor.

(d) Future DPL Users. This License does not extend to any DPL User whose Offering Announcement occurs later than Licensor’s last Discontinuation Date that has not been followed by a subsequent Offering Announcement by Licensor.

(e) Revocation and Termination Rights. Licensor reserves the right to revoke and/or terminate this License with respect to a particular Licensee if:

i. Licensee makes any Infringement Claim, not including Defensive Patent
Claims, against a DPL User; or
ii. Licensee grants an exclusive license, with the right to sue, or assigns or transfers a Patent to an entity or individual other than a DPL User without conditioning the transfer on the transferee continuing to abide by the terms of this License.

(f) Optional Conversion to FRAND Upon Discontinuation. As of any particular Licensee’s Discontinuation Date, Licensor has the right to convert the License of that particular Licensee from one that is royalty-free and no-charge to one that is subject to Fair, Reasonable, And Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) terms.

4.    Disclaimer of Claims Related to Patent Validity and Noninfringement. Licensor makes no representations and disclaims any and all warranties as to the validity of the Licensed Patents or that products or processes covered by Licensed Patents do not infringe the patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other intellectual property rights of any other party.

5.    Disclaimer of Warranties. UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE PATENT LICENSE GRANTED HEREIN “AS IS” AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED PATENTS OR ANY PRODUCT EMBODYING ANY LICENSED PATENT, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, REGARDLESS OF THEIR DISCOVERABILITY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IN WHICH CASE SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE.

6.    Limitation of Liability. LICENSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS LICENSE, INCLUDING INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES PRIOR TO SUCH AN OCCURRENCE.
